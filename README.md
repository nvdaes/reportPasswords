This add-on adds the option of speaking the text typed in protected controls like passwords, such as when logging into web-based email sites, where typed characters are spoken as asterisks.

Note: NVDA has an option to configure if typed passwords will be spoken in Windows terminals. This add-on won't affect those kinds of controls.

## How to configure

The add-on can be configured from its category in the NVDA's settings dialog, under NVDA's menu, Preferences submenu. A gesture for opening the add-on settings panel can be assigned from Input gestures dialog, configuration category.

Tip: If you have not configured NVDA to speak typed characters or words but want to hear typed text in passwords, you may create a configuration profile to enable the speaking of typed characters and passwords, and assign it to a gesture or create a trigger to enable it automatically in certain situations. For convenience, NVDA will ask if you want to create a dedicated profile when the add-on is installed.
